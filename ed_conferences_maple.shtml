                <p><strong>8:00 a.m.  Shuttle departs</strong> Hilton Garden Hotel to Morris Arboretum </p>
                <p><strong>9:00 a.m.  Welcome</strong>—Paul Meyer, <em>The F. Otto Haas Director of The Morris Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania</em>
                </p>
                <p><strong>9:10 a.m.</strong>  <strong>How to find your way in the multitude of Japanese Maples - Cor van Gelderen</strong><br><br>
                There are so many Japanese Maples nowadays, that many of our interns become disheartened, at the sheer sight of them. How are they ever going to understand, let alone know, all these cultivars. So they give up, before even having started. And I feel that the same feeling overcomes many of our customors as well. With that experience in my mind I have tried to come up with a solution. Grouping them in logical groups of related cultivars helps.  But defining logical groups is a bit of a challenge. In this lecture I will try to define logical groups of related cultivars and present them. Images of these plants will underline the advantages of cultivar groups.</p>

                <p><strong>10:30 a.m.  The evolution of the reproductive organs of maples in comparison with some phylogenetic trees of the genus Acer - Piet deJong                </strong></p>
                <p>The original inflorescences and flowers of maples have shown a whole series of reductions during the evolution of the genus.  The original heterodichogamous flowering has resulted in some taxa of the genus in complete dioecy and wind pollination.  A number of recently published phylogenetic trees show that the earlier divisions of the genus mainly based on morphologic characters of flowers and inflorescences were monophyletic sections and series. Some phylogenetic trees, however, show unexpected variations.</p>
                
                <p><strong>11:15 a.m.</strong>  <strong><em>Acer</em> section Platanoidea - Recent Asian introductions into cultivation - Dan Crowley </strong><br><br>
                In recent years there have been a number of Asian introductions to cultivation of members of Acer section Platanoidea. Among these are plants causing considerable confusion in terms of their identification and correct nomenclature.  For example, some of the introduced material listed under the same collection number has been identified as belonging to different taxa by different individuals/institutions and are growing in various botanical institutions under different names.  Recently published literature recording these inaccuracies further contributes to the confusion among this interesting group.  Dan is undertaking a project to ascertain which taxa are in cultivation and under what names. The correct identity of those in cultivation will be established, with the work then extending to the other members of the section and eventually culminating in a taxonomic revision of the section.   Here he will present the status of the project so far.</p>

                <p><strong>9:00 a.m.  100 Years of Maples at the Morris Arboretum - Anthony Aiello</strong><br><br>
                Starting with its founders John and Lydia Morris, there has been a long history of growing maples at the Morris Arboretum.  The Morrises purchased Japanese and Chinese maples from the Yokohama Nursery Company and from Veitch Nurseries and received plants from early plant explorations in China.  During the middle 20th century the Arboretum focused on building taxonomic collections of maples.  Over the past 30 years the focus has shifted to plants of wild-collected origin, primarily Asian species.  These have been supplemented by selected cultivars of maples.  In this talk, Tony will cover the history of maples at the Arboretum and discuss how this history reflects broader changes in plant collecting and exploration.  </p>
                
                <p><strong>9:45 a.m. <em>Acer</em>: Research perspectives past, present, and future - Richard Olsen</strong><br><br>
                Maples constitute one of the most important components of natural and urban forests in North America.  Our native maples are well represented, some would say overrepresented in our planted landscapes, however, they are complimented by species from throughout temperate areas of Europe and Asia.  Continued planting of some introduced species are tempered by invasiveness concerns.  The nursery industry is seeking urban tolerant, non-invasive, maples to fill the void.  Historic contributions of the USNA maple breeding program as well as current efforts, both at the USNA and other North American institutions, to address these needs will be highlighted. </p>

                <p><strong>11:00 a.m.  Creative integration of Maples into the gardens at Chanticleer and elsewhere - Dan Benarcik </strong><br><br>
                Maples are but one of the colors on our creative palette.  See how they can be combined and utilized to create an experience or expression larger than a simple plant combination.  Pruning, siting and simple choice of plant all fit into this larger equation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>11:45 a.m.  Pan-Asian Acer: Maples cultivated at UBC Botanical Garden - Douglas Justice</strong><br><br>
                Despite its small size, UBC Botanical Garden is well known for the diversity of its plant collections. The conditions at UBC are ideal for a large number of temperate plant groups, and maples represent one of the Garden’s most significant collections. Wild-provenance maples from Japan, South Korea, China, the Himalayas, Taiwan and Viet Nam make up most of the collection.   Many of these plants including a number of rarities, as well as companion plants representing other genera, will be discussed in this illustrated lecture.</p>

From 1977-1988 he was director of the Botanic Gardens of the University of Utrecht, with special attention for the Von Gimborn Arboretum. In that period he was one of the founders of the Dutch National Plant Collection and made study of the genera Betula and Euonymus.  After Utrecht he became researcher at the Station for Nursery Stock at Boskoop and published on Malus and Tilia.  His interest in maples remained and resulted in co-authoring Maples of the World in 1994 and lectures at former Symposia of the Maple Society. In retirement Piet is still active as volunteer in the Von Gimborn Arboretum with guided tours and growing and selecting plants. Last year he published a book on the Euonymus.</p>
