        <p>Springfield Mills is open for demonstrations during Mill Demonstration Days and at other times by scheduling a <a href="#tours">group tour</a>.</p>
        <a id="demo"></a><h3><strong>2016 Mill Demonstration Day Schedule</strong></h3>
        <p class="first"><strong>May 16th, June 19th with Insider Art Show, July 17th, August 21st, September 18th, October 16th with Bloomfield Farm Day.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Grist Mill Demonstrations are free. Donations appreciated.</em></p>
        <p>The grist mill is located directly across from the Arboretum’s main entrance on Northwestern Avenue. It offers visitors an interactive experience of a working 19th century mill. Visit the historic creek-side flour mill to watch one-ton millstones grind corn and wheat kernels and see 160 year old machinery transport and sift the grind to produce meal and flour. The flour is used to bake muffins on site. Kids and adults will also enjoy grinding their own flour on the pedal powered mill.</p>

        <h3>Springfield Mills History</h3>
        <p>Springfield Mills and the Miller’s Cottage date back to 1761 and are the oldest architectural features at the Morris Arboretum. Springfield Mills contains the most complete inventory of original flour mill works and related machinery of any mill in the area. The mill, with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Evans" target="_blank">Oliver Evans</a> mill works, provides a unique view of 19th and early 20th century agriculture and milling in the Wissahickon Valley. Volunteers and staff are actively engaged in restoring the mill with the goal of renewing its water-powered operation. Springfield Mills is a contributing structure in the Morris Arboretum’s National Register of Historic Places listing.</p>

        <p>The connections between food consumption, food production and land use is hard to imagine in a society where supermarkets with have become our main link to food.  The role of mills in communities is largely forgotten or taken for granted.  Springfield Mills creates a visual narrative of the social, economic and technological role mills play in food production and how important land conservation and plant diversity are to assuring we have food on the table.</p>
        <p>Farmers came from many miles to have their grain ground into flour.The Flourtown Village was the great wheat market of the eastern counties of the state around and north of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The mill used water power for an array of functions including sawing timber, grinding flour and animal feed, generating electricity, running agricultural machines and pumping water to irrigate the fields.</p><br>

        <p>The Run-of-the-Mill volunteers are restoring Springfield Mills to water-powered operation. The mill stones and water-powered machinery are over a century old. Volunteers work on the mill on the second Saturday of every month and operate the mill during public events at Bloomfield. Activities include carpentry, masonry, equipment restoration and general clean up. Research, documentation and education volunteers are welcome. </p>

      <h3>Questers Support Restoration of Springfield Mills</h3>
      <p>On May 5th, 2014 the Questers Fairwold Chapter with Pennsylvania State and International Questers presented a $7,000 grant to the Morris Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania for continued restoration of Springfield Mills.  The Fairwold Questers have supported restoration of the Morris Arboretum’s grist mill since 2008.  Previous grants restored the mill windows and the turbine pit bridge.  Both were critical elements in re-opening the mill for tours.  Most recently the historic, two-ton mill stones grinding surfaces were refinished by an expert millwright and are grinding corn meal after 60 years of inactivity.  This new grant will help restore the wooden “blow-out” wall facing the Wissahickon Creek.  The grant was presented by Vickie Sierchio, Fairwold Quester President.

Questers is an international organization with 101 chapters in PA and chapters in 41 states and Ontario.  Questers supports conservation and restoration of historical sites and objects.
