      <br><br>
        <p>When the University of Pennsylvania launched its <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/sustainability/about-us/our-climate-action-plan" target="_blank"><strong>Climate Action Plan 2.0</strong></a> in the fall of 2014, it increased its geographic footprint from the core academic campus, to more fully reflect the full range of the University’s built assets, incluing the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Morris Arboretum, the New Bolton Center, and Penn’s leased space and real estate projects.</p>  
        <p>As part of the Climate Action Plan 2.0, Morris Arboretum is documenting the current state of its environmental sustainability efforts to institutionalize best practices and build upon past successes, including landscape management, horticulture, the construction and operation of a LEED Platinum building, academic programs and community outreach and engagement.</p>
        <p>Morris Arboretum is committed to sustaining our natural resources. The 167-acre Arboretum property is a collection of landscape demonstrations exhibiting stewardship of different kinds of landscapes found throughout the metropolitan area.</p>

This equates to a lifetime of drinking water for more than 1,000 of our neighbors downstream, or the annual tap water used by about 4,000 households, or one day’s average tap water use by 366,245 Philadelphians. The parking lot will be renewed and rededicated in the fall of 2015 so as to continue its sustainable attributes.</p></div>
