                                 <dd>This collection spans approximately 200 years, from the late 1700s to the late 1900s, and five generations of the Morris-Shinn-Maier
                                    family, which are traced through matrilineal and patrilineal lines. They were prominent Quaker businessmen and lawyers in
                                    the Philadelphia area, and a large portion of the collection is dedicated to their legal and business material, as well as
                                    a great deal of very detailed financial material. There is also a quantity of personal material, namely diaries and correspondence,
                                    and material from philanthropic work done by later generations. Principal individuals include Paul David Irwin Maier, William
                                    Morris Maier, Anna Shinn Maier, Levi Morris and Naomi McClenachan Morris.

                           <p>History of the Harriton Estate: Rowland Ellis (1650-1731) was born in Dolgellu, Wales. He visited Pennsylvania in 1686, and
                              moved there in 1696. He settled on about 698 acres in a region designated by William Penn for Welsh Quakers. Ellis named his
                              property "Bryn Mawr," after his estate in Wales (which passed to his daughter Ann). Ellis is said to have built the mansion
                              house, which still exists as a museum, in 1704.
                           </p>
                           <p>Richard Harrison (?-174?) was a Maryland tobacco farmer, slave owner and Quaker. He married Hannah Norris in 1717, and bought
                              "Bryn Mawr" estate from Rowland Ellis in 1719. Harrison moved his family there from Herring Creek, Maryland. He renamed the
                              estate "Harriton," following the example of his father-in-law Isaac Norris, who named his New Jersey estate "Norriton." Richard
                              Harrison kept slaves at Harriton, which became one of the largest northern slave plantations of its time, but he was at one
                              point chastised by his meeting for keeping too many slaves. Harrison built a meetinghouse (which was razed in the 1820s) and
                              a family burial ground on Harriton grounds.
                           </p>
                           <p>Hannah Harrison Thomson (1728-1807) was the daughter of Richard Harrison and Hannah Norris Harrison, a Quaker minister whose
                              parents had been a prominent colonial official, and the daughter of a prominent colonial official. Hannah Harrison married
                              the Secretary of the Continental Congresses, Charles Thomson in 1774, and inherited the Harriton estate from her father after
                              his death. Hannah Harrison Thomson lived with her husband at Fourth and Spruce during his political career. After his retirement
                              in 1789, Hannah Harrison Thomson and Charles Thomson returned to her childhood home. Charles Thomson was an abolitionist,
                              and presumably it was he who ended the practice of keeping slaves at Harriton.
                           </p>
                           <p>The Thomsons had no children, and after helping to raise her great-nephew Charles McClenachan, the eldest surviving child
                              of his generation, they selected Charles to inherit the Harriton estate after their deaths. However, Hannah Harrison Thomson
                              died in 1807, and Charles McClenachan in 1811 (during the lifetime of Charles Thomson). Charles McClenachan then left his
                              inheritance to a six-week old daughter Naomi McClenachan, but under the terms of a life estate, Charles Thomson remained in
                              the old Harriton mansion until his death in 1824.
                           </p>
                           <p>Page Cadorus (1774-1840) was a former servant or slave, of black or mixed-race. He was a favorite of Charles Thomson, and
                              was probably raised in the Thomson household. During his lifetime, Charles Thomson gave Cadorus a life-estate on another part
                              of the Harriton property. The land was known as Cadorus (or Codorus) Farm, and was legally owned by Page Cadorus, but he never
                              resided there; instead, he leased it to tenant farmers.
                           </p>
                           <p>After Cadorus died in 1840, his life estate reverted back to the ownership of Naomi McClenachan Morris, who had inherited
                              the entire property from her father. She moved there with her husband, Levi Morris.
                           </p>
                           <p>Levi handled the management of the estate until his death in 1868, and under his guidance, the Harriton property was leased
                              to a number of tenant farmers. Levi also organized the building and leasing of a mill. He sold plots of land for their timber,
                              and then resold the land as a farm (called Woodleave Farm). There were a number of different farms on the Harriton property,
                              all of which generated money for the Morris family.
                           </p>
                           <p>It is unclear what buildings existed on this part of the property. A building called Lane’s End, which still stands, may have
                              housed Cadorus’ tenant farmer as well as a springhouse. The building as it stands now, however, was probably significantly
                              altered (if not entirely re-built) by Levi Morris during the nineteenth century. The same goes for the mansion house in which
                              the Morris family lived. There was probably a building on the same spot before the Morris’s moved to the property after Cadorus’
                              death in 1840, but it is unknown exactly what type of building. The current mansion may have been built on top of the former
                              building, or expanded from it. The old Harriton mansion built by Rowland Ellis and lived in by Richard Harrison and family
                              was the home of tenant farmers throughout the nineteenth century, but the Morris family never lived in it.
                           </p>
                           <p>In the late nineteenth century, Naomi McClenachan Morris decided that it was improper for a Quaker lady to live in a house
                              named after a slave—although Page Cadorus was not necessarily one—and she decided to rename the house and farm where she resided
                              "Harriton." After Naomi's death, her heirs squabbled over the "Harriton" name, and whether it should apply to the former Cadorus
                              region of the estate or to the original side, with the old mansion house.
                           </p>

                           <p>Earl Shinn (1796-1865) – Son of Samuel E. and Hannah Simpson Shinn, Earl Shinn married Sarah Comfort in 1822. Over the course
                              of sixteen years they had eight children: Elizabeth Shinn Haines (1823-1883), Anna Shinn Shipley (1826-1888), Lydia Comfort
                              Shinn Cadbury (1828-1904), Samuel Earl (1830-1855), James Thornton (1834-1907), Charles (died in infancy), Rebecca (1836-1882),
                              and Earl Jr. (1838-1886). Earl Shinn worked as a bricklayer and measurer and owned property in Philadelphia and the surrounding
                              areas. He and Sarah were prominent members of the Monthly Meeting of Philadelphia. In this collection, he is sometimes referred
                              to as E.S.

                           <p>Earl Shinn Jr. (1838-1886) – Son of Earl and Sarah Comfort Shinn, Earl Shinn Jr., against the wishes of his parents, sought
                              a career in painting and enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where he studied from 1859 to 1863. After a brief
                              stint in New York, he traveled to France in 1866 where he studied drawing at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under Jean-Leon
                              Gèrôme and helped establish the artists' colony at Pont-Aven on the Breton coast. His colorblindness and nearsightedness,
                              however, hindered him from becoming a professional artist. He returned to Philadelphia in 1868 and wrote art criticism for
                              the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin. In 1870 he moved back to New York where he remained an art critic until his death. During
                              that time he contributed to such publications as the Nation (for which he held the ambiguous post of art editor from 1874-1879),
                              Lippincott's Magazine, Scribner's Monthly, the New York Evening Post, and The Art Amateur. He was also a member of the Tile
                              Club, a group of New York artists and writers that included Winslow Homer, William Merritt Chase, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.
                              Shinn also wrote a series of books about art, including a catalogue of the art gallery at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in
                              Philadelphia, several volumes about modern French art, and two massive works about private art collections in America, all
                              under the pseudonym “Edward Strahan.” Through all of these writings he emerged as one of the leading American art critics
                              of the 1870s and 1880s yet simultaneously remained for the most part out of the public eye. In this collection, he is sometimes
                              referred to as E.S. Jr.

                              her husband James married her cousin, Emma.

                              Shinn in 1870. Her first child Morris Earl died at the age of two years old from measles. Her second and only surviving child
                              Anna married Paul D.I. Maier in 1906. Emma lived with her husband James next to James' pharmacy at the South West corner of
                              Broad and Spruce Streets. In the early twentieth century, Emma sold parts of the Harriton estate out of the family, effectively
                              splitting the old Harriton mansion and property, owned by the Vaux family, from the Cadorus (now "Harriton") side of the property,
                              owned by the Morrises and later the Maiers. In this collection, she is sometimes referred to as E.M.S.

                              1848 to 1849. In 1854 he enrolled at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy where he remained for two years. Upon the death
                              of his older brother Samuel Earl Shinn in 1855, he took control of his pharmacy on the corner of Broad and Spruce Streets
                              and operated it with his partner Thomas A. Montgomery until 1892 when they sold the business. In his retirement (and even
                              before it) he became a philanthropist, serving as secretary of the Pennsylvania Hospital, president of the board of managers
                              of the Catherine Street House of Industry, the Association Centre of University Extension Teaching, and the Philadelphia Vacant
                              Lots Association, and manager of the Philadelphia Fuel Savings Society and the Indian Rights Association. He married Ellen
                              Morris in 1863, three years before she died of cancer. In 1870 he married her cousin Emma Morris and they had a son, Morris
                              Earl (1871-1874) and a daughter, Anna Morris (1877-1941). In this collection, he is sometimes referred to as J.T.S.

                              had three daughters, Susan, Anna, and Anna Bella. Anna Shipley wrote poetry, some of which can be found in Occasional Poems
                              and Hymns, published by her family and friends shortly after her death.

                           <p>Samuel Richard Shipley (1828-1908) – Husband of Anna Shinn Shipley, Samuel R. Shipley served as president of the Provident

                           <p>Charles Thomson (1729-1824) – Secretary of the Continental Congresses, Charles Thomson is perhaps the most famous individual
                              in the Morris-Shinn-Maier Collection. Married to Hannah Harrison in 1774, Thomson lived after his retirement from politics
                              on his wife's estate. After Hannah Harrison's death in 1807, Charles Thomson remained in the Harriton mansion according to
                              his life-estate. An abolitionist, it may have been Thomson who ended Harriton's operation as a slave plantation. Thomson died
                              in 1824, just as Naomi McClenachan's guardians prepared to take him to court to force him off the Harriton estate. Thomson,
                              and his wife Hannah, were buried in the Harriton family burial ground in unmarked graves. In 1838, their bodies were disinterred
                              and transplanted to Laurel Hill Cemetery amid controversy over the ownership of the bodies and the burial ground. Due to the
                              lack of head stones, however, the bodies of Charles and Hannah Thomson may still reside in the Harriton graveyard.

                              property of his wife's family after her father Levi Morris died in 1868. He also served as Secretary and Treasurer of the
                              Swatara Coal Company and involved himself in numerous charitable organizations. For much of his adult life he lived at 1715
                              Arch Street, Philadelphia. In the 1880s, Vaux built a "cottage" called "Llysyfran" on his children's share of the Harriton
                              property. This cottage was later torn down to make way for Cavershem road. Also on his children's property, George Vaux built
                              a house, "The Thicket," which now houses Bryn Mawr College's English House.

                              to the Board of Indian Commissioners, a post he held until his death. Throughout his life he continued his father's practice
                              of philanthropy and community involvement. He married Mary Walsh James in 1907 and they had two sons, George Vaux X (1908-1996)

                                       <p>This subseries is made up of receipts from the Morris family. The receipts begin in the 1820s, when Levi Morris lived alone.
                                          Levi Morris and Naomi McClenachan Morris married in 1831 and lived first in Philadelphia, moving to Harriton, which she inherited
                                          from her father, in 1840. Levi died in 1868, at which point Naomi began managing the farm with the assistance of her daughter
                                          Catharine Wistar Morris and her son-in-law, James Thornton Shinn. After her death in 1893, Catharine Wistar Morris and James
                                          Thornton Shinn managed the farm. The receipts end in 1904 for unclear reasons.

                                       <p>The receipts are organized as they were found, bundled and labeled by year. There has been no organization of the receipts
                                          beyond that provided by those bundles.

                                          Waln had taken his customary seat, being attired in his usual fashionable dress, when, arising from his place, he went into
                                          the ministers' gallery, and kneeling offered the following prayer: "O Lord God, arise, and let thine enemies be scattered!--baptize
                                          me with the baptism wherewith Thou wast baptized--dip me yet deeper in Jordan--wash me in the laver regeneration. Thou hast
                                          done much for me, and hast a right to expect much; and in the presence of this congregation, I resign myself and all that
                                          I have to Thee;--it is thine;--and I pray thee, give me resolution in this to continue firm. Wheresoever Thou leadest me,
                                          O Lord, I will follow Thee, throuh persecution even unto martyrdom: if my life be required, I will freely sacrifice it.--Now
                                          I know that my Reedeemer liveth. The mountains are removed--Hallelujah! Teach me to despise the shame, in the opinion of the
                                          people of this world. Thou knowest, O Lord, my deep baptisms--I acknowledge my manifold transgressions--I know my unworthiness
                                          of Thy favors which I have received. I thank Thee, father, that Thou hast hid thy mysteries from the wise and prudent, and
                                          hast revealed them to babes and sucklings." There being a considerable time before he expressed a word, and one of the elders,
                                          James Pemberton, stretched out his hand to lay it on him, when Nicholas, with much emphasis, said, "Touch not the shewbread
