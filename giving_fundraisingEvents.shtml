        <h3>2015 Honoree</h3>
        <p>This year we honor Moses “Moe” Feldman and his wife, Susan, for their extraordinary volunteerism and unwavering commitment to the Morris Arboretum.  Moe and Susan became members in the 1990s.  In 2005, they increased their involvement by joining the Arboretum’s Directors’ Guild. Moe became a key member of the Campaign Cabinet during the Always Growing Campaign, which concluded in 2012.  Currently, Moe is Chair of the Arboretum’s Finance Committee and Vice Chair of the Advisory Board of Managers.  He is the Founder and Retired Chairman of Aeromed, Inc. and is currently the President and Partner of Osteofixator, LLC.  We are excited to celebrate the Feldman’s many contributions to the Morris Arboretum over the years.</p>
        <h3>Co-chairs</h3>
        <p>We are pleased to have Natalie and Ralph Hirshorn and Elizabeth and Kyle Salata as this year’s co-chairs for <em>Moonlight &amp; Roses Presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em>.  
Natalie and Ralph are longtime friends and neighbors of the Arboretum, having served as past members of the Directors’ Guild.  Natalie has been involved with <em>Moonlight &amp; Roses Presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em> for more than a decade serving on the planning committee. Natalie is the office manager at McCoubrey/Overholser Building Construction and Ralph is Chairman of The Hirshorn Company, an insurance/H.R. services firm established in 1931, located in Chestnut Hill. </p>
<p>Elizabeth and Kyle Salata are dedicated supporters of the mission of Morris Arboretum. As a lifelong local resident, Elizabeth has many happy memories of trips to the Arboretum. The appreciation she gained for nature and ecology through those visits can be seen today in her involvement with managing Erdenheim Farm. Kyle, who grew up in Douglassville, PA, is a Compounding Pharmacist and owner of AdvancedRx Pharmacy in East Norriton.  They now live next door to the Arboretum. </p>

        <h2>How the event helps the Arboretum</h2>
        <p><em>Moonlight &amp; Roses presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em> is the Morris Arboretum’s annual fundraising gala that raises money for the arboretum’s annual operations.

        <h2 class="first">History of <em>Moonlight &amp; Roses presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em></h2>
        <p>What could be better than a magical night of dining and dancing under the stars, surrounded by the lush beauty of roses in bloom? As a longstanding Arboretum tradition, the <em>Moonlight &amp; Roses presented by The Haverford Trust Company Gala</em>, which always takes place in early June, is unsurpassed.</p>

        <p>In 2011 we celebrated our 30th anniversary of <em>Moonlight &amp; Roses presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em> and 650 guests enjoyed cocktails and hors d’oeuvres at in the glorious Morris Arboretum Rose Garden and 360 guests stayed for dinner under the moonlit tent.</p>
        
        <p>The lively garden party we now know as <em>Moonlight &amp; Roses Presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em> has had a colorful evolution. In the early 1970’s, it was dubbed the Spring Fling, and was held on the lawn behind Gates Hall. The late Jane O’Neill was instrumental in the success of the gala in those early days.</p>
        
        <p>In the 1980’s, patrons and contributors donned their garden party attire for the event that was rechristened <em>Moonlight &amp; Roses presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em>. The evening traditionally begins with cocktails served in the Rose Garden, while dinner, served by a very professional catering staff, is held in a festive tent atop the hill near the Widener Visitor Center, music and dancing round out the evening of friendly conversation and gourmet dining.</p>
        
        <p><em>Moonlight &amp; Roses presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em> has always provided and intimate setting unique to Philadelphia charity events, and is enjoyed by a capacity crowd each year. While we always order perfect weather for this wonderful evening, not even a passing summer shower can dampen the warm enthusiasm of those in attendance, who simply bring umbrellas so they can still view our fabulous rose garden in full bloom. The Morris Arboretum's annual fundraising gala, <em>Moonlight &amp; Roses presented by The Haverford Trust Company</em>, has become a tradition among friends, families, and colleagues in the Delaware Valley.</p>
