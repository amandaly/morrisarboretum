                <br>
				<p><strong>Accessibility</strong><br>
Renovations began in January on the George D. Widener Education &amp; Visitor Center. The project includes the expansion of the buildingâ€™s main entrance, and the installation of automatic front doors that will comply with ADA standards for accessible design. The entrance will also be more stroller friendly, making it easier for families to navigate the building.</p>
                <p><strong>Visitor Center Plaza</strong><br>
 In addition to the improvements being made to the building itself, the surrounding plaza will also be enlarged and enhanced.A new 30x30 area will provide a larger gathering space for tours, and will help reduce congestion on high visitation days. The larger terrace will also feature sitting walls and benches toprovide additional seating.</p>
                <p><strong>Membership Kiosk</strong><br>
The membership kiosk will be relocated within the plaza and will be expanded to enable staff to welcome visitors more efficiently. New plantings will be added. When finished, the area will provide a pleasant, relaxing space for visitors to gather and linger.</p>
                <p><strong>Closure and Visitor Access</strong><br>
The Shop at Morris Arboretum will remain closed until construction is completed toward the end of March. Visitors and those enrolled in classes may encounter inconveniences which we apologize for in advance. The Visitor Center remains open for programs (like classes) and conveniences.  Look for signage indicating an alternative entrance.</p>
                <p><strong>Special Thanks</strong><br>
<em>Morris Arboretum wishes to thank longtime Arboretum friend, Edith Dixon for making these enhancements possible. This attractive new area will allow the Arboretum to accommodate a broader audience and its improved functioning will enhance the experience of every visitor.</em></p>
