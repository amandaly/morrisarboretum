        <h4><strong>Big Bugs Garden Etiquette</strong></h4>
        <p>The Big Bugs art sculptures are fragile and CAN NOT be climbed on. This rule not only helps to preserve the artwork, but more importantly, is for the safety of our visitors. No-Climb signage has been posted throughout the garden as a reminder and we thank you for your cooperation.</p>
        <p><strong>Members: </strong><em>We welcome you to be ambassadors for the Arboretum and encourage your support of the 'no-climb' etiquette with newcomers. Thank you!</em></p>
